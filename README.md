  in TypeScript. In this template, Hono is used to handle HTTP requests.
- **Nx**: A project management tool that helps organize code and dependencies.
  It is used to structure the application and run tasks such as build, testing,
  and deployment.

### Why use this template:

- Simple setup and high performance thanks to Hono.
- Nx helps manage the project and dependencies, making development more
  convenient.
